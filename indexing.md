# indexing 

at a higher level, we have some external documents that we want to load and put inside of a retriever, and the goal of this retriever is to fish out some document from external data store that is relevant to the question as input to the retriever.

to start, **embeddings** are numerical represenations of objects (like text, images, audio) that are represented as vectors aand are designed to capture meaningful relationships between them, since it is very easy to compare vectors as opposed to words. we also have two options for vector representation, **sparse vectors** or **dense vectors**.
